This folder contains both my matlab file matMult.m that computes the time to multiply various sizes of matrices.  It also contains 2 c files that both calculate the time for multiplication one for ints and one for floats.  I hardcoded those times into the matlab file to plot.  The matlab script plots the 3 lines of the times, I have also included an image of the plot in this folder.
