Included is all the code for the multigrid solver, conjugate gradient (cg.c), and preconditioned conjugate gradient.  In preconditioning I ran one full mglin using ncycle=1.  For the timing I measured runtime per timestep for all 3 methods and the number of iterations for both cg and preconditioned cg.  The make file can be used to run everything.  There are 3 sets of code in the driver to run each of the 3 methods, I have commented 2 of them out and you can just move the comments around to run the various different methods.  Let me know if you have any questions.
