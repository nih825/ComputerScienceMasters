I have included the following files: ftcs, GaussSeidel, successive_over_relaxation, jacobi_iteration, and driver.  I have included .cpp and .h files for all of these.  To compile simply use g++ but make sure you are compiling with std=c11.  The driver has code to run 1 iteration of each of the 3 methods.  I have commented 2 out and only included 1 of the methods, so if you want to run another method just comment the current code out and uncomment out the code for the other method.  My code assumes constant boundary and nx=ny=nz.  Let me know if you have any problems compiling the code or any questions about the code in general.
