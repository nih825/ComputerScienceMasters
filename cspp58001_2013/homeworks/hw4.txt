Homework #4 
Due Thursday, March 21st,

Using C, C++, Fortran, Python, or Java:

a. Create a multigrid solver (FMA) for the 2-D time-dependent heat equation
with source term using the Backward Euler (BE) discretization. 
That is, solve dT/dt = del^2 T + S(x,y).
Include separate routines for relaxation, residual, coarse solution,
interpolation (interpolate + add error), and coarsening. (30 pts)

b. Create an un-preconditioned CG solver for the same problem. (30 pts)

c. Carry out the following benchmark comparisons of CG vs. multi grid vs. SOR 
and present results. (30 pts).
[these details will be added shortly]

d. Use a single multigrid cycle as a preconditioned for CG
and add the results to a comparison in c. (10 pts)
