CSPP51037 Homework 3 
due: aug 20


Port your reversi application to a Swing/XML/servlet architecture as follows:

Client 1 -- Java application using Swing

Client 2 -- Java application using Swing

Server: A deployed http server (provided) which supports java
        servlets/jsp

The reversi clients should be written as reasonable looking regular
swing applications (this is a good chance to practice a bit more with
swing, but we still won't obsess over appearance). Upon launching a
client the client will establish connection with the server and wait
for a second client connection before accepting the first move. ALL
client to server communication will be done using XML over http. You
can prepare this any way you want -- by hand with or without
higher-level java libraries, using a SOAP server, etc. The class
prototype will provide a guide for using Java DOM parsing and the
URLConnection class. Also, after each move the current state of the
game will be written to disk on each client in a validated, custom XML
format.
